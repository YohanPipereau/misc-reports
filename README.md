# misc-reports

Here are some reports I wrote as part of projects.

### Python-openVAS

OpenVAS Vulnerability Scanner CLI wrapper for scan automation & clusterization during my internship as a summer student at CERN in Summer 2017.
This gives a context for the the code you can find [here](https://github.com/YohanPipereau/python-openvas).
The report is available [here](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2281765/files/report.pdf).

## Communications between kernel and user space

In order to provide a new mechanism for communication between kernel and user space in Lustre filesystem during my internship at CEA during Summer 2018. I had to assess performance of the different mechanisms available in Linux Kernel.
